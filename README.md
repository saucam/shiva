# shiva
shiva is a library for Simple High dimensional Indexed Vector search Algorithms.

Basic guiding principle is to be:
- Simple (non-distributed, single thread indexing, easy to use)
- Support high dimensional vectors, optimize memory for speed
- Support many different distance metrics
- Scale out to different indices and algorithms
